deimosplate.stl is finished and ready to print, not sliced but no modifications are needed (but it's 2mm thick, do of that what you will!)
If you want to print each separate half, if i am lazy and in the next times don't change anything, you have to make some modifications.
Don't worry, it should be easy!
